Participated in a comprehensive interdisciplinary study focused on physiological and emotional responses under various conditions. The study utilized
Empatica E4 wristbands to collect biosignals like electrodermal activity, heart rate, and temperature across three different acquisition rounds. 
Involved in both data collection and analysis, the experiment aimed to understand the correlation between induced emotions and biosignal patterns.
Responsibilities included sensor calibration, data capture, and participant coordination. Analysis involved correlating self-rated emotion
